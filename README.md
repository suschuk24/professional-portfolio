# Professional Portfolio README

## README Notes: 

Welcome to my professional portfolio page and thank you for taking the time to visit my README! Please bear in mind this page and the attached links are works in progress. With that in mind, please note that the "frigin-platypus" link redirects to run-buddy. This is beacuse frigin-platypus is not currently deployed due to pending changes.

## Below are screenshots of the page, rendered at different scales:
